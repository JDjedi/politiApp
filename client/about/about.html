			<p>
				The election of Donald Trump in 2016 heralded a new era of Presidential communications. Twitter allowed Trump to speak to his followers directly and concisely thus allowing him to circumvent the filter of the U.S. National Media. A plethora of new terms have been added to the Political Lexicon such as "Twitter Diplomacy" and the "Twitter Presidency". 
			</p>
			<p>
				While many ascribe the use of twitter as an instrument of political and policy communication solely to Trump's eclectic personality we believe, on the contrary, that this is no passing fad or phenomenon. Twitter, or micro-blogs in general, has shown itself to be too effective in getting a message out quickly to people on a mass scale. This sort of political communication is here to stay and will continue to grow in use and prominence.
			</p>
			<p>
				In acknowledgment of those trends we here at polis see an opportunity to show you what the people within the U.S. government are thinking. By gathering and displaying all high government officials twitter posts in one area an effective snapshot can be given of what people in power are thinking. Personnel is Policy and by knowing what the people in power are thinking it may be inferred the policy the U.S. government may take.

				So go ahead, take a look, analyze and enjoy. Welcome to polis.
